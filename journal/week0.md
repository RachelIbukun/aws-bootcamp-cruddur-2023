## Required Homework

### Install AWS CLI

I was able to install AWS CLI by creating code repository on Github and I used Gitpod Codespaces to edit my code and successfully commit it.
This was not possible at first because the initial response I got was that I did not have permission to push. I was able to rectify this challenge by enabling and updating all permissions in the workspace under the gitpod settings.
