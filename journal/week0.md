# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework

### Install AWS CLI

I was able to install AWS CLI by creating code repository on Github and I used Gitpod Codespaces to edit my code and successfully commit it.
This was not possible at first because the initial response I got was that I did not have permission to push. I was able to rectify this challenge by enabling and updating all permissions in the workspace under the gitpod settings.


### Create a Budget
I created a budget via the Billing console. I created my budget for $2 to avoid overspending. I only created one budget to avoid overspending my free limit in two places.
